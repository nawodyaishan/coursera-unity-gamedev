# Repository for [C# Programming for Unity Game Development Coursera Specializartion](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/programming-unity-game-development#about)
### Personal Progress, assignemnts, and learning materials are included.

## Course 1 - Introduction to C# Programming and Unity

This course is all about starting to learn how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers; Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.

This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building small games by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games.

Computer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially the first half of a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Module 1: Write your first C# console application and Unity script 
Module 2: Learn how we store data in our programs
Module 3: Learn how we use classes and objects to implement our code
Module 4: Learn the basics of Unity 2D games and take "Final Exam"

## Course 2

This course is the second course in the specialization about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers; Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.

This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous course in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking that previous course or from personal experience, before tackling this course. Throughout this course you'll continue building your foundational C# and Unity knowledge by exploring more C# and Unity topics and finishing the Unity game you started at the end of the previous course.

The material in this and the previous course is essentially our first programming course for Game Design and Development majors at UCCS.

Module 1: Learn how we make decisions in our code
Module 2: Learn how to get and use player input in your Unity games 
Module 3: Learn how to use iteration (looping) to repeat actions in your code
Module 4: Learn how we can store lots of data in arrays and lists

## Course 3

This course is the third course in the specialization about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally.

Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.

This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. Throughout this course you'll continue building your foundational C# and Unity knowledge by exploring more C# and Unity topics.

The material in this and the previous two courses is essentially our first programming course for Game Design and Development majors at UCCS.

Module 1: Learn about abstraction and how we can use it to design and implement console application classes
Module 2: Learn more about how methods and parameters work
Module 3: Learn how we can use abstraction to design and implement Unity classes
Module 4: Add text output (like score!) and sound effects to your Unity games

## Course 4

This course is the fourth course in the specialization about learning how to develop video games using the C# programming language and the Unity game engine on Windows or Mac. Why use C# and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, C# is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers; Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment.

This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous three courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed in the "Who this class is for" section below. Throughout this course you'll build on your foundational C# and Unity knowledge by developing more robust games with better object-oriented designs using file input and output, inheritance and polymorphism, and event handling.

This course gives you even more tools to help you build great games with C# and Unity!

Module 1: Start using files to implement your Unity games
Module 2: Learn how inheritance and polymorphism help us write less code for our games
Module 3: Implement event handling to make better object-oriented designs and add menus to your Unity games
Module 4: Explore the complete implementation of a small Unity game
Module 5: Complete final peer review
